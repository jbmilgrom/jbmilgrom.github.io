    <p>he 2013 NFL season reminded us that efficiency kills. On the field, despite an arm that would have been laughed out of the combine, Peyton Manning and a near-unstoppable Broncos offense set virtually every passing record by marching their way down the field eight yards at a time. Denver scored 606 points mostly by staying ahead of schedule. The team that eventually managed to shut it down, Seattle, was the league’s most efficient club off the field, as driven by Russell Wilson, owner of the league’s best contract. By delivering above-average quarterback play for less than $700,000, Wilson allowed the Seahawks to spend millions of dollars on the luxury of depth elsewhere. The players Seattle signed with that money — notably defensive linemen Cliff Avril and Michael Bennett — were key contributors in its run to a Super Bowl trophy. Manning is better than Wilson, but the $16.8 million difference between the two QBs’ cap hits is the superior choice.</p>
    <p>And now, with the booming example of Russell Wilson ringing in our ears, it’s time for the third annual NFL Trade Value Column here on Grantland. Just as I did in 2012 and 2013, I’ve gone through each of the league’s 32 teams and identified the top 50 trade assets in football. There’s only one change this year: Now that I’ve successfully graduated from Trade Value School, Grantland editor-in-chief and Trade Value godfather Bill Simmons has given me permission to take this thing out for a spin on my own this year. Will I end up wrapping my boss’s greatest invention around a tree? Let’s see.</p>
    <p>1. Contracts matter. Joe Flacco is probably a better quarterback than Andy Dalton, but Flacco is in the middle of a franchise-killing, six-year, $120 million deal, while Dalton’s in the final season of a rookie contract that will pay him less than $1.7 million in 2014. The Bengals will have to pay Dalton soon if they want to keep him, so his contract isn’t quite as good as it was when he still had three years left at that price.</p>
    <p>2. Contracts don’t matter as much as they do in the NBA version of this column. NBA contracts are guaranteed and clearly defined. NFL contracts have nonguaranteed base salaries as well as bonuses that are often paid early in a deal, even as the cap hit stretches across the length of the contract. Those bonuses then accelerate onto the current cap in the event of a trade, but the team can also get out of the contract without having to pay the nonguaranteed base salaries if they wa— you’re falling asleep. Just work through this. For the purposes of this column, we’re considering both the specific nature of the current point in the player’s contract (e.g., Randall Cobb having just one year left on his contract) as well as the broader terms of the contract (e.g., the entirety of Cobb’s deal). And in terms of our hypothetical trades, we’re pretending — just for this moment — that there’s no salary cap acceleration.</p>
